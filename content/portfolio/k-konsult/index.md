[K-Konsult Ltd](https://www.k-konsult.com/) is a project I've managed for a while, creating a simple and stylish website for a Renewable Energy Services and Consulting company. Used LESS and Gantry Framework for the template, built as a fixed width site for simplicity.

Originally built in Joomla!, the site has since been converted into a static site since it isn't updated often and also to harden the site against attacks. Whilst not responsive, at the time it was built, K-Konsult had no need for targeting a mobile audience given its target market.
