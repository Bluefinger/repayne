[Tama Productions](http://www.tamaproductions.co.uk/) is a website for the UK-based, award winning Film Production company that produces thought-provoking and creative film. Built with Wordpress, it was designed specifically to showcase their portfolio as the main focus and entry point of the website.

Using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as the base for their template, the homepage was a complete custom design and implementation to combine multiple embed sources (Youtube, Vimeo) into one coherent slider, complete with thumbnail navigation. Built with responsive and mobile devices in mind, the website provides a consistent experience across devices to showcase Tama Production's best works. Built by myself at [boxChilli](https://www.boxchilli.com/).
