[Funding for Contractors](https://www.fundingforcontractors.co.uk/) is a firm that focuses on providing funding for recruitment agencies and contractors. The site was built to provide a client portal to manage applications by recruiters and contractors, using custom built forms to store and manage each part of the process.

The website is built in Joomla!, using the Gantry Framework as the base for their template as well as using RSForms Pro for putting together the forms and client area. Built by myself at [boxchilli](https://www.boxchilli.com/).
