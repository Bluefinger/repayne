[Portico Marketing](http://www.portico-marketing.co.uk/) is a firm specialising in interior and aerial property photography for estate agents. Their website was built by myself at [boxChilli](https://www.boxchilli.com/), to fulfill their needs for not only a portfolio of their work, but also a client area for uploading their commissioned pictures.

The website is built in Joomla!, using the Gantry Framework as the base for their template. Their homepage was designed specifically for being a flashy entry point to their portfolio, using a layout inspired by the Microsoft's Metro UI (though done towards Portico's style and colours based on their logo). Using CSS filters for the hover effects, the result is a modern and stylish website, built with responsive in mind.
