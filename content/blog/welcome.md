Welcome to Code Payne, my personal portfolio and blog for front-end and web related musings. Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and made pretty thanks to [Zurb's Foundation framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and some CSS/JS niceness. The lightbox and gallery feature is [ViewerBox](https://github.com/Bluefinger/ViewerBox.js), another project of mine that I developed specifically for this website.

The Hugo theme I built for the site was based on [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) initially, but then modified heavily for the Zurb Foundation framework.
