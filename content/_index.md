Description = "About Gonçalo Rica Pais da Silva"
+++

I'm Gonçalo Rica Pais da Silva (or Gonçalo Rica Payne in the UK), a front-end web developer now located in Barcelona. I specialise in Typescript and Javascript, along with HTML and CSS, though I'm also experimenting and learning Rust at the moment. I focus mostly on front-end development, and dabble occasionally in other areas like Node.js and whatever I can do with Rust. On the occasion I am inspired towards my own projects, I put my stuff onto [Github](https://github.com/Bluefinger). Otherwise, I am a recluse in terms of my social media presence.
